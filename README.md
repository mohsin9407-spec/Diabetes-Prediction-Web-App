## Project: Diabetes Prediction Web App

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Flask web application that uses a trained logistic regression model
to predict whether a person is diabetic based on the  Diabetes dataset.

## Contents
- app.py                 : Flask web application (serves pages and prediction endpoint).
- train_model.py         : Script to train and save the model as model.pkl.
- model.pkl              : Pickled trained model (generated by train_model.py — usually not committed).
- requirements.txt       : Python dependencies.
- templates/             : HTML templates (index.html, result.html) — create if missing.
- static/                : Static files (CSS, images) — optional.

## Quick notes

- Consider adding `model.pkl` to .gitignore (models are often large and sensitive to include in repo).
  Example .gitignore entry: model.pkl

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

## Install dependencies
Create a virtual environment (recommended) and install:
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate    # macOS / Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows (PowerShell)
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Train the model (optional)
If you want to re-train the model locally (train_model.py downloads dataset from the web):
    python train_model.py
This will create a file named `model.pkl` in the repository directory.

## Run the web app
Make sure `model.pkl` exists (either from train_model.py or supplied).
Then run:
    export FLASK_APP=app.py       # macOS / Linux
    set FLASK_APP=app.py          # Windows (cmd)
    flask run

Or run directly (development mode with debug):
    python app.py

Open your browser and go to:
    http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## API / Predict endpoint
The app exposes a form at `/` and posts to `/predict` (method POST).
Expected form fields (names used in app.py):
- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigree
- Age

## Response
The app renders a result page showing "Diabetic" or "Not Diabetic" based on the model prediction.

## Recommended repository improvements
- Add templates/index.html and templates/result.html with form and presentation.
- Add input validation and user-friendly error messages.
- Add Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
- Add CI (GitHub Actions) for linting and tests.
- Move model artifacts to a release, model registry, or object storage (avoid committing large binaries).
- Add README.md (Markdown) for nicer formatting on GitHub.
- Add LICENSE (MIT/Apache) and CODE_OF_CONDUCT if you plan to accept contributions.

## Security considerations
- Never expose your trained model or secrets publicly if they contain sensitive information.
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Set debug=False in production.

## Example .gitignore (minimal)
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    venv/
    .env
    model.pkl
